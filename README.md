# introduction

An alternative time system by Benno van Hilten

## Basics

The day is split into seven 'winds' (pronounced as in winding a clock).

Seconds are the smallest units, and are the same duration as conventional seconds.

A 'bit' is ten seconds plus an extra second (called the 'seconscious').

A 'play' is ten bits plus an extra bit and second.

A 'sharp' is ten plays plus an extra play, bit and second.

Each wind is made up of ten sharps, plus and extra play, bit and second.

There is little magic in the sequence, and a few seconds grace at the end of the day, which allows the total number of seconds to match that of the conventional 24 hour clock.

## Winds

The winds each have a name and color, in sequence these are:
- alma (magenta)
- lua (deep purple)
- llum (dark blue)
- eto (yellow)
- vida (green)
- oorun (orange)
- ruby (red)

## Colors

The other units follow a spectrum from red to violet.

So the first second, we call '0' is red.
The last second, called 'X' is violet.

## Demo
